## A few words ‚úçÔ∏è

#### Introduction
Hi, I'ml L√©o, I like creating a bunch of stuff by smashing my keyboard. This project is part of my journey in 3D graphics. I've wanted to implement by myself the [Marching Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_cubes) algorithm. I cannot state how much [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvwVYJY_IZ4)  helped me in debugging my code, I'm also using [Deadlock's triangulation table](https://pastebin.com/6TN46s9p).

#### Why do that

I've wanted to implement that algorithm due to a few games based on voxels that I always really liked :
 - [Astroneer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/361420/ASTRONEER/).
 - [Ace of spades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/224540/Ace_of_Spades_Battle_Builder/) and [Open Spades](https://openspades.yvt.jp/).
 - [Teardown](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1167630/Teardown/).
 - [Space Engineers](https://store.steampowered.com/app/244850/Space_Engineers/) asteroids.
 - And of course, everyone's favorite cube game, [Minecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft).

#### Current features

Currently, the demo has a working camera that you can control using the listed keybinds below.
You can toggle the wireframe by pressing X and reset chunks with V. Note that doing so will regenerate all the active chunks. <br>
If your computer allows it, you can enable the auto chunk check to always generate and load chunks in a radius around you. I have implemented Web Workers to generate each chunk. However the generation is done on the CPU. An active web worker counter is displayed in the info panel. <br>
Web workers are terminated if they are currently working on chunks that are no longer used, in order to avoid computations on chunks that won't be used. <br>
If the auto chunk check is not enabled (disabled by default), you can press C to refresh the active chunk list to chunks around you. <br>

#### Precautions with chunk radius
Please be careful when upping the chunk radius. It is generally better to increase the size of a chunk instead of teh radius, as each chunk will spawn a worker. A high radius leads to sometimes absurd amounts of workers; I do not recommend going past 5, which already spawns 515 of them.

#### Issues in Chrome and Opera
I'm aware of very bad performance in Chrome and Opera, however I do not think I have much control on that, though I'll look into it. No issues spotted running the demo on Firefox with a beefy machine. My setup runs an hexacore i5-10400 and a GTX-1660S and loads it pretty fast.
